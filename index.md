    headline: Seamless Cloud vs Apache Airflow
    content: You can automate routine tasks by running code on Apache Airflow. It
      is a highly sophisticated tool, used heavily in complex data pipelines. It is
      an overkill for code that automates small tasks. You need to read quite a lot
      of documentation before you can get started. You also need to set up a server
      and support it.

    headline: Seamless Cloud vs AWS Lambda
    content: You can automate routine tasks by running code as Lambdas in AWS. It
      is not super hard to get started once you've read the documentation. AWS is
      very flexible, which comes at a price - to monitor and debug the tasks, you
      need to have an in-depth DevOps knowledge of other AWS services.

    headline: Seamless Cloud vs Cron Jobs
    content: You can, if you wish, do everything from scratch. If you can write a
      cron job and run it on a server, you can automate anything. But, as with all
      solutions "from scratch" comes a lot of work. You need to set up a server and
      start a cron job manually. You have to keep the cron job running (which is one
      of the most time-consuming tasks over time since it includes setting up monitoring,
      log streaming, etc.)
